When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It could be a backup, but more than likely it would be for collaborative development work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Well, if more than one human being is working on it, you may or may not want their changes before knowing
what they are.  Another consideration, when would Git pull it?  Right in the middle or your changes, thereby
overwriting them?
